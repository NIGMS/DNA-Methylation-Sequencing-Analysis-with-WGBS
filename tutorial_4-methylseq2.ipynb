    "For real-world datasets, the sequence file sizes are usually too large to process using a single virtual machine (Vertex AI notebook), or take a long time. In this tutorial, we will show how to run a nf-core/methyseq pipeline to process WGBS data using the Google Batch.  \n",

    "The [**Google Batch**](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/google.html#cloud-batch) is a managed computing service that allows the execution of containerized workloads in the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. It provides a simple way to execute a series of Compute Engine containers on Google Cloud. The most common use case when using Google Batch is to run an existing tool or custom script that reads and writes files, typically to and from Cloud Storage. Nextflow provides built-in support for Google Batch, which allows the seamless deployment of a Nextflow pipeline in the cloud, offloading the process executions through the Google Cloud service. Google Batch can run independently over hundreds or thousands of these files. \n",

    "## <a name=\"FULL\" />Configuration of a Full-scale Dataset - Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full-scale WGBS study, the sequencing data size can range from several hundred GBs to several TBs. For example, the data we downloaded in this tutorial: GSE30340 and GSE19418, both have many runs with the size add up to several hundred GBs. Given the large data files, the storage and memory can become an issue when running the pipeline as instructed in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options that we can use to download the data:\n",
    "1. Download the data in a notebook. You need to make sure that the disk size you assigned to the notebook is enough for the data that you want to download. Also, when you use `prefetch` from SRA toolkit, there is a default maximum download-size of 20G; you will need to increase that limit.  \n",
    "2. Cloud Data Delivery Service. SRA has created a cloud data delivery service to deliver the source files and other file types from NCBI cold storage buckets to individual data consumers' buckets in AWS and GCP. This service is provided for both public and authorized access (dbGaP) data. [More detailed information here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/data-delivery/).\n",
    "3. Upload to the storage bucket directly. You can upload the data to the GCP storage bucket directly from your local computer, HPC, or service server using the `gsutil` tool. [More detailed information here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/discover-object-storage-gsutil). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting the nf-core pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "If the nf-core pipeline does not complete successfully, you can refer to the [troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting) page that nf-core provided for more information. For our tutorial here, the most likely reasons that the pipeline fails are:\n",
    "- service account is not set up correctly\n",
    "- file paths are not correct\n",
    "- memory or storage issues for large dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a command exit status of 104, 134, 137, 139, 143, 247, the most probable cause is an \"out of memory\" issue. To solve the memory issue, you need to increase the memory limit in the configuration file for the process that fails. For example:   \n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "profiles {\n",
    "    gcb {\n",
    "      process {\n",
    "        withName: qualimap { \n",
    "              machineType = 'c2-standard-16'\n",
    "              cpus = 16\n",
    "              memory = 64.GB\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In GCP, the memory is also limited by the [machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) you select to run the process. For example, if you choose `c2-standard-8` then the memory is limited to 32GB. You can change the machine types to increase the memory. There are [memory-optimized machine families](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/memory-optimized-machines) (m1, m2) that you can use for workloads that require higher memory-to-vCPU ratios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimize nf-core/methylseq configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The nf-core/methylseq workflow contains multiple processes, and the requirements of computational and memory resources for each process vary a lot. For better performance or billing purposes, you can change the configuration for each process. You can check the default settings for each process at the pipeline's [base.config](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/blob/master/conf/base.config) file. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of running a 12 sample WGBS data, [docs/optimization_example.config](docs/optimization_example.config) was the config file that finish processing these 24 fastq files (pair-end, averge size 325M reads per fastq file, ) using Google Batch in less than 30 hours."
