    "Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework and a programming DSL (Nextflow defaults to DSL 2 if no version is specified explicitly) that eases the writing of data-intensive computational pipelines. Linux provides many simple but powerful command-line and scripting tools that, when chained together, facilitate complex data manipulations. Nextflow extends this approach, adding the ability to define complex program interactions and a high-level parallel computational environment based on the dataflow programming model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice a Nextflow pipeline script is made by joining together different **[processes](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html)**. Each process can be written in any scripting language that can be executed by the Linux platform (Bash, Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.). Processes are executed independently and are isolated from each other, i.e. they do not share a common (writable) state. The only way they can communicate is via asynchronous FIFO queues, called __[channels](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html)__ in Nextflow. Any process can define one or more channels as input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nextflow interacts with many different files to have a proper working workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Main file__: The main file is a `.nf` file that holds the processes and channels describing the input, output, a shell script of your commands and workflow\n",
    "- __Config file__: Pipeline default configuration properties are defined in a file named `nextflow.config` in the pipeline execution directory.The `.config` file contains parameters, and multiple profiles. Each profile can contain a different __executor__ type (e.g. LS API, conda, docker, etc.), memory or machine type, output directory, working directory and more. \n",
    "- __Docker file (optional)__: Contains dependencies and environments that is needed for the Nextflow workflow to run.\n",
    "- __Schema file (optional)__: Schema files are optional and are structured .json files that contain information about the usage and commands that your workflow will execute.You might have seen this when you run a command along with the flag '--help'.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This tutorial provided a comprehensive introduction to Nextflow and its application in analyzing WGBS data using the nf-core/methylseq pipeline within the SageMaker notebook instance.  We began with a basic Nextflow script to illustrate core concepts like processes and channels, highlighting the pipeline's flexibility and reproducibility facilitated by Docker containers.  Subsequently, we explored the nf-core/methylseq pipeline, detailing its workflow and execution using a sample dataset, comparing its output to the Bismark workflow from a previous tutorial.  The tutorial concluded by demonstrating how to manage output files, emphasizing the importance of transferring relevant results to cloud storage and cleaning up intermediate files for efficient resource management.  The included quiz further reinforces the key concepts learned throughout the notebook."

    "Transfer useful results back to an Amazon S3 bucket, and remove intermediate files. In this tutorial, the most important output files are the methylation profiles (.bedgraph.gz) of each sample. We will use these data to identify differentially methylated regions using metilene in the next tutorial.\n",

    "For example, you can upload/copy all the .bedgraph.gz files to the bucket you created in Cloud Storage by using:     \n",

    "**Don't forget:** after finish running the notebook, stop the notebook in Vertex AI Workbench to avoid cost accumulation."
