    "## Overview\n",
    "For real-world datasets, the sequence file sizes are usually too large to process using a single virtual machine (SageMaker notebook), or take a long time. In this tutorial, we will show how to run a nf-core/methyseq pipeline to process WGBS data using the AWS Batch.  \n",

    "The **[AWS Batch](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/aws.html#aws-batch)** is a managed compute service that allows the execution of containerized workloads in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides a simple way to execute a series of containerized tasks on AWS. The most common use case when using AWS Batch is to run an existing tool or custom script that reads and writes files, typically to and from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Nextflow provides built-in support for AWS Batch, which allows the seamless deployment of a Nextflow pipeline in the cloud, offloading the process executions through the AWS service. AWS Batch can run independently over hundreds or thousands of these files."

    "* **Understand and utilize AWS Batch for large-scale WGBS data analysis:** Learn how to overcome limitations of single notebook instances by leveraging AWS Batch's managed compute service for processing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Set up a Nextflow IAM role and configure notebook permissions:** Learn to create and configure an IAM role with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services (Batch, S3) from a Jupyter Notebook environment in SageMaker. This includes understanding and applying the principle of least privilege and enabling required service endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Configure Nextflow for AWS Batch execution:** Learn to create and modify a Nextflow configuration file to specify AWS Batch as the executor, define AWS region, compute environment (including instance type, spot/on-demand settings, and resource allocation) working directory, and output directory in Amazon S3. Understand the implications of choosing different instance types and their resource implications, including understanding the cost-effectiveness of spot instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Run the nf-core/methylseq pipeline on AWS Batch:** Learn to execute the nf-core/methylseq pipeline using AWS Batch, including specifying pipeline version, profiles, and config files. Understand the differences in runtime between small test datasets and larger real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Process real-world WGBS datasets using nf-core/methylseq and AWS Batch:** Gain practical experience downloading and processing a real-world WGBS dataset using the `fasterq-dump` tool and creating a samplesheet for the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Troubleshoot large-scale pipeline execution:** Learn to identify and resolve common issues such as out-of-memory errors by adjusting instance types and memory allocation within the Nextflow config file and AWS Batch settings. Understand how to optimize pipeline configurations for resource usage.\n",

The notebook guides you through its creation. The notebook utilizes the bucket, with subdirectories like `workdir` and `output`,  for data storage when using AWS Batch or other processing services.\n",

    "### Configuration of a Full-scale Dataset - Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full-scale WGBS study, the sequencing data size can range from several hundred GBs to several TBs. For example, the data we downloaded in this tutorial: GSE30340 and GSE19418, both have many runs with the size add up to several hundred GBs. Given the large data files, the storage and memory can become an issue when running the pipeline as instructed in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options that we can use to download the data:\n",
    "1. Download the data in a notebook. You need to make sure that the disk size you assigned to the notebook is enough for the data that you want to download. Also, when you use `prefetch` from SRA toolkit, there is a default maximum download-size of 5G; you will need to increase that limit.  \n",
    "2. Cloud Data Delivery Service. SRA has created a cloud data delivery service to deliver the source files and other file types from NCBI cold storage buckets to individual data consumers' buckets in AWS and GCP. This service is provided for both public and authorized access (dbGaP) data. [More detailed information here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/data-delivery/).\n",
    "3. Upload to the S3 bucket directly. You can upload the data to the Amazon S3 bucket directly from your local computer, HPC, or service server using the `aws s3` tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting the nf-core pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "If the nf-core pipeline does not complete successfully, you can refer to the [troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting) page that nf-core provided for more information. For our tutorial here, the most likely reasons that the pipeline fails are:\n",
    "- service account is not set up correctly\n",
    "- file paths are not correct\n",
    "- memory or storage issues for large dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a command exit status of 104, 134, 137, 139, 143, 247, the most probable cause is an \"out of memory\" issue. To solve the memory issue, you need to increase the memory limit in the configuration file for the process that fails. For example:   \n",
    "```\n",
    "profiles {\n",
    "    aws {\n",
    "        process {\n",
    "            withName: qualimap {\n",
    "                instanceType = 'ml.m5.2xlarge'  // Or another suitable instance type\n",
    "                cpus = 16\n",
    "                memory = 64.GB\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In AWS, the memory is also limited by the [notebook instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-available-instance-types.html) you select to run the process. For example, if you choose `ml.m5.2xlarge` then the memory is limited to 32GB. You can change the machine types to increase the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimize nf-core/methylseq configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The nf-core/methylseq workflow contains multiple processes, and the requirements of computational and memory resources for each process vary a lot. For better performance or billing purposes, you can change the configuration for each process. You can check the default settings for each process at the pipeline's [base.config](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/blob/master/conf/base.config) file.  \n",
    "As an example of running a 12 sample WGBS data, [docs/optimization_example.config](docs/optimization_example.config) was the config file that finish processing these 24 fastq files (pair-end, averge size 325M reads per fastq file, ) using Google Batch in less than 30 hours."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrated how to leverage AWS Batch within the Nextflow framework for efficient WGBS data analysis using the nf-core/methylseq pipeline.  We addressed the limitations of processing large datasets on single virtual machines by outlining the necessary steps for setting up a Nextflow service account, configuring an Amazon S3 bucket, and creating a Nextflow config file tailored for AWS Batch execution. The tutorial progressed from a test run with a small dataset to a more realistic example using real-world SRA data, highlighting the process of data acquisition, samplesheet creation, and pipeline execution.  Finally, we provided crucial guidance on troubleshooting issues common to large-scale datasets, including memory management, and offered strategies for optimizing pipeline configuration for enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness.  The successful completion of this notebook empowers users to efficiently analyze sizable WGBS datasets using the scalability and resource management capabilities of AWS."
