    "## Overview\n",
    "For real-world datasets, the sequence file sizes are usually too large to process using a single virtual machine (SageMaker notebook), or take a long time. In this tutorial, we will show how to run a nf-core/methyseq pipeline to process WGBS data using the AWS Batch.  \n",

    "The **[AWS Batch](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/aws.html#aws-batch)** is a managed compute service that allows the execution of containerized workloads in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides a simple way to execute a series of containerized tasks on AWS. The most common use case when using AWS Batch is to run an existing tool or custom script that reads and writes files, typically to and from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Nextflow provides built-in support for AWS Batch, which allows the seamless deployment of a Nextflow pipeline in the cloud, offloading the process executions through the AWS service. AWS Batch can run independently over hundreds or thousands of these files."

    "\n",
    "For a full-scale WGBS study, the sequencing data size can range from several hundred GBs to several TBs. For example, the data we downloaded in this tutorial: GSE30340 and GSE19418, both have many runs with the size add up to several hundred GBs. Given the large data files, the storage and memory can become an issue when running the pipeline as instructed in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options that we can use to download the data:\n",
    "1. Download the data in a notebook. You need to make sure that the disk size you assigned to the notebook is enough for the data that you want to download. Also, when you use `prefetch` from SRA toolkit, there is a default maximum download-size of 20G; you will need to increase that limit.  \n",
    "2. Cloud Data Delivery Service. SRA has created a cloud data delivery service to deliver the source files and other file types from NCBI cold storage buckets to individual data consumers' buckets in AWS and GCP. This service is provided for both public and authorized access (dbGaP) data. [More detailed information here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/data-delivery/).\n",
    "3. Upload to the storage bucket directly. You can upload the data to the GCP storage bucket directly from your local computer, HPC, or service server using the `gsutil` tool. [More detailed information here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/discover-object-storage-gsutil). \n",

    "- service account is not set up correctly\n",
    "- file paths are not correct\n",
    "- memory or storage issues for large dataset\n",

For better performance or billing purposes, you can change the configuration for each process. You can check the default settings for each process at the pipeline's [base.config](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/blob/master/conf/base.config) file. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrated how to leverage Google Batch within the Nextflow framework for efficient WGBS data analysis using the nf-core/methylseq pipeline.  We addressed the limitations of processing large datasets on single virtual machines by outlining the necessary steps for setting up a Nextflow service account, configuring a Google Cloud Storage bucket, and creating a Nextflow config file tailored for Google Batch execution.  The tutorial progressed from a test run with a small dataset to a more realistic example using real-world SRA data, highlighting the process of data acquisition, samplesheet creation, and pipeline execution.  Finally, we provided crucial guidance on troubleshooting issues common to large-scale datasets, including memory management, and offered strategies for optimizing pipeline configuration for enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness.  The successful completion of this notebook empowers users to efficiently analyze sizable WGBS datasets using the scalability and resource management capabilities of Google Cloud Platform."
