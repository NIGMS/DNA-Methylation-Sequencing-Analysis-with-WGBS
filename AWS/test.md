The Jupyter Notebook's learning objectives are:

This Jupyter notebook performs a WGBS (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing) data analysis using the Bismark pipeline within Google Cloud Platform's Vertex AI Workbench.  Here's a breakdown of the prerequisites:

**1. APIs that should be enabled:**

* **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):**  Essential for downloading the example dataset and reference genome.  The notebook uses `gsutil` commands to interact with GCS.
* **Vertex AI Workbench:** This is the environment where the notebook runs.  It needs to be provisioned and configured.

**2. Cloud Platform Account Roles that must be assigned:**

The required roles depend on how the Vertex AI Workbench instance is set up and whether the user needs to create buckets.  At a minimum, the user needs a role that allows:

* **Storage Object Admin:**  To download data from and upload data to Google Cloud Storage.  This is a very powerful role, and a more restrictive role (e.g., Storage Object Viewer and Storage Object Creator) should be considered if possible.
* **Vertex AI User:** To access and use Vertex AI Workbench.

**3. Necessary Cloud Platform Access:**

* **Vertex AI Workbench instance:** A running Vertex AI Workbench notebook instance is required.  This instance should have sufficient compute resources (CPU, memory, and disk space) to handle the computational demands of the Bismark pipeline.  The notebook specifically mentions the need for at least 4 cores (`-j 4` flag in `trim_galore`).
* **Google Cloud Storage bucket:** Access to the GCS bucket (`gs://nigms-sandbox/dna-methyl/`) containing the example dataset and reference genome is necessary.  The user needs read access to this bucket.  The notebook also implies the user might need to create their own GCS bucket to store results.


**Additional Notes:**

* **Software Dependencies:** The notebook installs several bioinformatics tools using `mamba` (a conda package manager).  These include `fastqc`, `multiqc`, `bismark`, `trim-galore`, `bedtools`, `samtools`, `metilene`, and `igv-notebook`.  The notebook provides the commands to install these.
* **Internet Access:** The notebook requires internet access to download software packages and data from GCS.
* **Linux Environment:** The notebook uses Linux commands (`mkdir`, `wget`, `tar`, etc.), so it's assumed to be running in a Linux environment (which is standard for Vertex AI Workbench).
* **Reference Genome:** The notebook uses the mouse genome (GRCm39, chromosome 6).  If you want to analyze a different organism, you'll need to provide the appropriate reference genome FASTA file.


In summary, the user needs a GCP account with the appropriate roles and access to GCS and Vertex AI Workbench, along with sufficient computational resources within the workbench instance to run the Bismark pipeline successfully.  The notebook itself provides the commands to install the necessary software.
